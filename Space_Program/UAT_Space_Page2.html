    Welcome to the UAT Space Program! Glad you could make it.
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>Below you will find the buttons that control this page's timer!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <!--This is the start button. It enables and disables so far.-->
        <button id="startButton" onclick="start();">Start toggle</button>
        <!--Button to display the time.-->
        <button onclick="display()"; class="button">Get current time</button>
        <!--this controls the countdown button only. Changed "start" to "begin" during last update to avoid conflicts with other toggles.-->
        <button id=countdownButton onclick="begin();" class="Buttons">Count Down</button>
        <!--This is the stop button. It enables and disables so far.-->
        <button id="stopButton" onclick="stop();">Stop toggle</button>

    <!--This loads an audio player on the screen that allows the user to control a sound. CAUTION: IT IS LOUD, BUT THERE IS A PLAY/PAUSE.-->
    <audio controls autoplay loop> <!--this does not autoplay, even with "controls" removed.-->

    <p>Perhaps you might want to stay awhile and listen to some serene sci fi sounds? Close your eyes and relax.</p>

    <!--Below I embedded a video from YouTube. It is an ambient playlist featuring "space sounds", and is very relaxing to take a moment and imagine yourself in the weightlessness of space. Adrift, million miles from home, yet peaceful. And not at all filled with existential terror and dread. :)-->
